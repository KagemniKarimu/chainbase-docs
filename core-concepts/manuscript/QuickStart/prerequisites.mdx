# 1. Software Requirements
### Docker
Ensure that Docker is properly installed and functional on your system, as it is essential for the Manuscript environment setup. Docker enables deployment and management of isolated containers required by Manuscript's ecosystem. For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).

### Docker Compose
Alongside Docker, Docker Compose is required and should be correctly installed and configured. Docker Compose enables the orchestration of multi-container applications, making it easier to deploy and manage Manuscript's dependencies. For setup guidance, refer to the [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Linux Environment
Manuscript is designed for compatibility with Linux environments only. Ensure that you have access to a Linux-compatible system, such as macOS, CentOS, or Fedora. either directly or through a Linux-based container setup in Docker, to proceed with the installation and operation of Manuscript.

# 2. Checking for Requirements
On a native Linux system, you can use the `uname -a` command to obtain information about your Linux distribution.

If you are not using a native Linux system and need a Linux environment through Docker, you can check if Docker is installed by following these steps:

1.Open a terminal or command prompt.

2.Run the following command to verify that Docker is installed and operational:
```
docker --version
docker compose version
```
If Docker is installed and running, you can proceed with setting up a Linux-based environment within a Docker container, which provides the necessary compatibility for Manuscript installation.

# 3. CLI Installation

To download a binary for latest release, run:
```
curl -fsSL  https://github.com/chainbase-labs/manuscript-core/raw/main/install.sh | bash
